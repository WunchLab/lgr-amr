Seems like the computer switched to energy saver mode, changing sleep settings such that computer
attempted to got to sleep while instruments on.
Support is that computer had power (blue LED at side was on) but had a blank
screen when we openned it at the end of the bike ride.
To fix, we need to change power saver settings on laptop
